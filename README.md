# Numerical analysis of the gravitational $n$-body problem

As part of my term project for University of Waterloo's PHYS349 - Advanced Computational Physics, I will develop a model for the gravitational $n$-body problem, with an extra challenge to create a user interface.

## File structure

```
|- assets
|- tex
|- logs
|- src
|  |- tests
|  |- v1
|  |- v2
|  |- view
```

- assets: contains all the images and other files used in the project
- tex: contains the LaTeX files for the report
- src: contains all the source code
- tests: contains all the unit tests
- v1: contains the first version of the project
- v2: contains the second version of the project
- view: contains the user interface
- logs: contains the logs of the unit tests
